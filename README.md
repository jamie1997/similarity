# similarity
consine-similarity and one-shot-similarity

this dataset has two tests,1:1 verification and 1:n identification  
we will compute the similarity of features using cosine and one-shot similarity.  
probe_ada.m means 1:1 verification using one-shot similarity  
probe_cosine.m means 1:1 verification using cosine similarity  
gallery_cosine.m means 1:n identification using cosine similarity  
gallery_ada.m is missing hhh
